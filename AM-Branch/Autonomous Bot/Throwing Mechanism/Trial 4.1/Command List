r -> Only deploy position (No sensor check and stuff) --- Debugger ONLY
i<num> -> Trigger the IR[num] after 3 seconds ON, stay ON for 3 seconds and then turn off
p<num> -> Turn ON the IR[num]
l<num> -> Turn OFF the IR[num]
t<num> -> Set the encoder threshold to 'num'. The 0 is after the receive position, after 'num' ticks of the encoder, open gripper
o -> Open gripper on the throwing arm
c -> Close gripper on the throwing arm
m<pwm> -> Actuate the throwing arm motor at 'pwm' in the throwing direction.
	It also opens flap before actuation, but it's suggested to use f and then a z500. 
d<0 or 1> -> Toggle the direction of rotation (move the motor in the direction opposite to the throwing direction), use m<pwm> before this.
	0 will set direction to opposite to throwing sense and 1 will set rotation to throwing direction.
f -> Retract flap servo 
g -> Deploy flap servo
z<num> -> Hault all execution for 'num' milliseconds
a (or e) -> Home position (with the sensor work)
